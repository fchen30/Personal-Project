Personal-Project
================
This is a small Java program  that I wrote based on what I have learned from Youtube and Internet related to Java language.

Right now I can only use simple loops, create classes and use method and create objects. 

The idea of this program is simple caluclation for exam scores, a is add scores to the exam you have created, b is create a new exam with a list of scores, if the sum of the sores is not much the total score number you have entered, the exam will not created, c is display information of the exam,q is quite the program, ? is display the menue

This this program, I have implement a switch loop for menue selection, a Scanner object to take user imput, if statments for decision making, and other Java functions.
