Personal-Project
================
This is a small Java program  that I wrote based on what I have learned from Youtube and Internet related to Java language.

Right now I can only use simple loops, create classes and use method and create objects. 

The idea of this prgram was same from our CIS340/CIS345 class, which is simple caluclation, but I translated the code from C# to Java, and added formating from what I have learned in Java.
